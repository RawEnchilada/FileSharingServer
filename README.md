# File Sharing Server

This is a server side rendered page based on express and ejs, which let's you pick a folder and share it through the web.
Files are readonly, uploaded files(coming soon) go to the upload folder beside index.js.

### Configuration:

The server uses a config.json file to set parameters like the shared folder and server port.

Node.js 15.0.0 or newer required.
